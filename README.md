# CFD-openFOAM-projects
My CFD projects simulated using OpenFOAM solvers. 
The three projects so far are all multiphase flow problems (water + air) solved using the interFoam solvers in OpenFOAM.   
The geometries and the meshing are all generated by me using Gambit.  

To run each case, first go into its directory and then run
```
blockMesh
```
This will generate the geometry mesh of the problem. Then run 
```
setFields
```
to set the initial fields of the problems. You can then run 
```
interFoam 
```
to run the simulation. In order to post-process the data you will need to use paraView.  

I encourage you to try changing the files in constant and system to vary the boundary conditions, initial conditions, integration time,  fluid properties and etc.
